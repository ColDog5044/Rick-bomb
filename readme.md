> # Rick-Bomb Batch

## Requirements

You need your file extension of choice, .exe or .bat, and the VBScript. This will only work on Windows machines.

## .bat

The .bat contains the source code and will open a console window

## .exe

The .exe contains everything in the .bat, however, the .exe **will NOT** open a console window.
